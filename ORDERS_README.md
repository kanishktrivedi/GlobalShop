## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure
Orders are stored in Firestore with this structure:
```javascript
{
  userId: "user_uid",
  currency: "USD",
  items: [
    {
      id: "product_id",
      name: "Product Name",
      qty: 2,
      unitPriceOriginal: 199.99,
      unitPriceConverted: 199.99,
      currencyOriginal: "USD",
      currencyConverted: "USD"
    }
  ],
  subtotalOriginal: 399.98,
  subtotalConverted: 399.98,
  taxConverted: 27.998,
  totalConverted: 427.978,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp()
}
```
